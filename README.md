# Reload

Reload automates hot-reloading of configuration files.   
It allows to monitor multiple configuration files (currently supporting JSON) and automatically reload them whenever changes are made, without the need to restart your application.   
Reload offers error handling and auto-rollback functionality to ensure that your application doesn't crash if there's an error in your configuration file. 
Reload is actively being developed and maintained.
