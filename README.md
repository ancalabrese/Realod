# Reload :arrows_counterclockwise:

Reload automates hot-reloading of configuration files.   
It allows to monitor multiple configuration files (currently supporting JSON) 
and automatically reload them whenever changes are made, 
without the need to restart your application.   
Reload offers error handling and auto-rollback functionality to ensure that 
your application doesn't crash if there's an error in your configuration file. 
Reload is actively being developed and maintained.


## Features :computer:

- Configuration hot-reloading
- Multiple config file monitoring
- Configuration validation


## Appendix :rocket:

Reload is still in active development and currently in beta. 
We’re working on adding even more features and functionality 
to make managing configuration even easier. 
Any feedback and contributions are welcome!
